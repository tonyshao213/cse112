Grader:  copy this file into the student's directory and grade
according to the following point values.  There are a max of 30
points for the program and 30 points for the test run.  

The numbers in parens are the max points for a particular section.
Enter some number between 0 and the max depending on the quality
of the work.

PROGRAM SOURCE CODE. (30)

        (3) Run checksource.  Deduct 1 point per different
            file complained about, but not more than 2 points.
            checksource README *.ml *.mli >check.log

            DO NOT DEDUCT POINTS for complaints about generated
            files:  parser.{mli,ml} and scanner.ml.

        (3) Look at the code.  Formatted reasonably?  Properly
            indented?  Good choice of identifiers?

        (3) Code to implement the INPUT statement

        (3) Code to implement the DIM statement

        (3) Code to implement the LET statement

        (3) Code to implement the IF statement

        (3) Code to implement the GOTO statement

        (3) code to evaluate operator expressions

        (3) code to evaluate function calls and arrays from
            the symbol table

        (3) function interpret uses tail recursion in all cases

total source code score:  /30
Minimum score is 1 if the directory exists.

TEST RUN.  (30)

Record a score of zero to two points for each of the following
test programs.  Indicate why any point loss.

        00-hello-world.mb
        01-1to10.mb
        02-exprs.mb
        10-exprs.mb
        11-let.mb
        12-syntax.mb
        20-goto.mb
        21-let-if.mb
        22-fibonacci.mb
        23-pi-e-fns.mb
        30-quadratic.mb
        31-collatz.mb
        32-factorial.mb
        40-sort-array.mb
        41-eratosthenes.mb

total test run score: /30

________________________________________________________________________

Add up the two numbers out of 30 and enter the score below at
the end of the line that says SCORE=.  TOTAL SCORE ENTERED BELOW
BETWEEN 1 and 60.  A score of 0 is used to indicate nothing was
submitted.  If they submitted anything at all, it is worth at
least 1 point.

TOTALSCORE=

If the student is doing pair programming verify that the partner's
directory exists.  If not mkdir.  Then cp SCORE into it.  Also
make sure the symlink PARTNER points in both directions.
