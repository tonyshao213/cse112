Grader:  copy this file into the student's directory and grade
according to the following point values.  There are a max of 30
points for the program and 30 points for the test run.  

The numbers in parens are the max points for a particular section.
Enter some number between 0 and the max depending on the quality
of the work.

PROGRAM SOURCE CODE. (30)

        (2) Run checksource.  Deduct 1 point if <= 10 complaints,
            else deduct 2 points.  Consider both files.
            checksource README mbint.st >check.log
            Score 0 for this item interpreter is not mbint.st.

        (3) Look at the code.  Formatted reasonably?  Properly
            indented?  Good choice of identifiers?

        (3) Code to manage the label dictionary.
            Preliminary scan to create it.

        (3) Code to implement the INPUT statement

        (3) Code to implement the DIM statement

        (3) Code to implement the LET statement

        (3) Code to implement the IF statement

        (3) Code to implement the GOTO statement

        (3) code to evaluate operator expressions

        (2) code to look up variables and arrays in their dictionary

        (2) code to use labelDict in ifStmt and gotoStmt

total source code score:  /30
Minimum score is 1 if the directory exists.

TEST RUN.  (30)

        Record a score of zero to two points for each of the
        following test programs, except use a max of 3 ponts
        for those output labelled (max 3).  Indicate any point loss.

        00-hello-world.mbst

        01-1to10.mbst

        02-exprs.mbst

        10-exprs.mbst

        11-let.mbst

        12-syntax.mbst

        20-goto.mbst

        21-let-if.mbst

        22-fibonacci.mbst

        23-pi-e-fns.mbst

        30-quadratic.mbst

        31-collatz.mbst

        32-factorial.mbst

        40-sort-array.mbst

        41-eratosthenes.mbst

total test run score: /30

________________________________________________________________________

Add up the two numbers out of 30 and enter the score below at
the end of the line that says TOTALSCORE=.  TOTAL SCORE ENTERED
BELOW BETWEEN 1 and 60.  A score of 0 is used to indicate
nothing was submitted.  If they submitted anything at all,
it is worth at least 1 point.

If doing pair programming look for the TOTALPAIR= score in
SCORE.pair.  Deduct points specified in TOTALPAIR.

Set TOTALSCORE = source code score + test run score + TOTALPAIR.
Note:  TOTALPAIR is from -10 to 0, but the other two are positive.

TOTALSCORE=

If the student is doing pair programming verify that the partner's
directory exists.  If not mkdir.  Then cp SCORE into it.  Also
make sure the symlink PARTNER points in both directions.
