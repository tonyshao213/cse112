1.  Logic Programming in Prolog

You will use Prolog to write an airline reservation system for the
Twilight Zone Airlines.  Given a request to travel from one city to
another, print out the flight schedule.  For each leg of the trip,
print out the departure airport, airport, city name, and time.  For
example:

?- fly( lax, sea).
depart  LAX  Los Angeles     14:22
arrive  SFO  San Francisco   15:29
depart  SFO  San Francisco   16:02
arrive  SEA  Seattle-Tacoma  17:42

A database has been provided which lists some airports, their cities,
and the North latitudes and West longitudes of the airports.  A flight
schedule has also been provided listing the departure and arrival
airports and the departure times.

2.  Notes about the logic of the program

 (a) To compute the distance between airports, use the haversine
     formula.  The database contains degrees and minutes, which must
     be converted to radians.  The result must be converted to miles.

 (b) Planes fly at a constant speed of 500 miles per hour and always
     using great circle paths, so the arrival time can be computed
     from the departure time.

 (c) A flight transfer always takes 30 minutes, so during a transfer
     at a hub, the departure of a connecting flight must be at least
     30 minutes later than the arrival of the incoming flight.

 (d) There are no overnight trips.  The complete trip departs and
     arrives in the same day, although the final arrival time may be
     shown as greater than 23:59.

3.  Running swipl

You may load a script by the command
   swipl -s filename.pl
or by just running swipl at the command line, then loading a module
with the Prolog command [filename] In this latter case, do not include
the .pl suffix in the consult command.  To avoid colorized diagnostics
from swipl, you may put the following line in $HOME/.swiplrc:
   :- set_prolog_flag(color_term,false).
When searching for Prolog functions, include the string swipl in your
search to avoid finding advice about other Prolog implementations.

4.  What to Submit

Submit one file:  functions.pl.  Also submit README, and if
applicable, PARTNER.  The grader will copy in the files .score/
database.pl and the test data.
