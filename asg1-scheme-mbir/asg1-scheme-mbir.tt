1.  Overview

Scheme is a dynamically typed (mostly) functional language with a very
simple syntax.  In this assignment, you will write a Mini Basic
language interpreter in Scheme.  The interpreter will read in an
intermediate language program, parse it, and then interpret it.  No
looping constructs may be used, so it is critical that certain parts
use proper tail-recursion to avoid function call stack overflow.

2.  Examples Directory and Readme

/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cse112-wm/Languages/scheme/Examples/

Also look at the references in README.html or README.text in this
directory for some tutorials and references.  When using google, be
sure to look for references to Racket and Mzscheme.  There are other
implementations of Scheme which are not necessarily exactly
compatible.

3.  Running mzscheme Interactively

It will be very convenient for you to run mzscheme interactively for
testing purposes simply by invoking it from the command line, as in:
   -bash$ mzscheme
   Welcome to Racket v7.4.
   > (expt 2 128)
   340282366920938463463374607431768211456
   > (sqrt -1)
   0+1i
   > (acos -1)
   3.141592653589793
   > ^D
To do this, be sure to put it in your $PATH.  This can be done by
putting the following lines in your .bash_profile:
   export PATH=$PATH:/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cse112-wm/usr/racket/
bin
Of course, you may prefer to collapse these multiple shell commands
into a single line.  If you use a different shell, then setting your
$PATH will be done differently.

To use the arrow keys on the keyboard to edit previous lines in
interactive mode, put the following line in a file $HOME/.racketrc:
   (require readline)
Or, after starting mzscheme, enter the above command before any other
interaction.  Or, put the following line in your .bash_profile:
   alias wscheme='rlwrap mzscheme'
Then start mzscheme with the command wscheme instead.  This only works
at the command line, so don't use it in the #!  line of the program
script.  rlwrap is a program that wraps another program in the
readline utility, allowing use of common terminal editing facilities,
such as the use of the arrow keys.

4.  A Mini Basic Interpreter

NAME
     mbir.scm -- a Mini Basic Interpreter

SYNOPSIS
     mbir.scm [-d] filename

DESCRIPTION
     The mbir interpreter reads in an mbir program from the file whose
     name is specified in the argument list, stores it in a list, and
     then interprets that intermediate representation.  During
     interpretation, numbers are read from the standard input and
     results written to the standard output.

     Error messages are printed to the standard error.  The first
     error, whether during compilation or interpretation, causes a
     message to be printed and the program to exit with an exit code
     of 1.

OPTIONS
     None.

OPERANDS
     The single filename argument specifies an mbir program to be run.

EXIT STATUS
     If the program completes without error, 0 is returned.  If not, 1
     is returned.

HISTORY
     BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was
     designed at Dartmouth College, NH, by John Kemeny and Thomas
     Kurtz in 1965.  A variation of that language was ROM BASIC,
     distributed by IBM on their original PC in 1980.

     Mini Basic is somewhat related.  This description of the Mini
     Basic programming language, assumes that certain things are
     intuitively obvious.  There are only two data types in the
     language:  strings and numbers.  Strings are used only in print
     statements.  There are no string variables.  Variables are
     floating point numbers.

     Edsger W. Dijkstra:  ``It is practically impossible to teach good
     programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC:
     as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope
     of regeneration.''  -- EWD498.
     EWD manuscripts are archived at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/.

THE MBIR LANGUAGE
     This is a top-down definition of the mbir language, specified
     using a variation of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), the format used to
     specify Algol-60, yet another one of the ancient languages.  In
     the metanotation, brackets indicate that what they enclose is
     optional, braces indicate that what they enclose is repeated zero
     or more times, and a bar indicates alternation.  Italics indicate
     nonterminal symbols and token classes, while quoted courier bold
     indicates literal tokens.

      (a) Program-> `(' { `(' Linenr [ Label ] [ Statement ] `)' }...
          `)'

          A program consists of zero or more statements, each of which
          might be identified by a label.  Labels are kept in a name-
          space separate from the Variable namespace and do not
          conflict with each other.  The program terminates when
          control flows off the last statement.  A statement with
          neither a label nor a statement is considered just a comment
          and not put into the statement list.

STATEMENTS
     Statements are the only organizational structure in the language
     and are executed one by one in sequence, except when a control
     transfer occurs.  There is no block structure or nesting.

      (a) Statement-> `(' `dim' Arrayref `)'
          Arrayref-> `(' `asub' Variable Expression `)'

          The dim statement creates an array given by the variable
          name and inserts it into the array table, replacing any
          previous array already in the array table.  The dimension of
          the array is given by the expression.  All values in the
          array are initialized to 0.0 (as a real).  The expression is
          rounded to the nearest integer before being used as the
          bound, which must be positive.  Since the size of the vector
          must be an integer, use (make-vector (exact-round size) 0.0)
          to create the array.  A subscript $i$ must be in the range $
          0 <= i < n $, where $n$ is the dimension.

      (b) Statement-> `(' `let' Memory Expression `)'
          Memory-> Arrayref | Variable

          A let statement makes an assignment to a variable.  The
          expression is first evaluated.  For a Variable, its value is
          stored into the Symbol table, replacing whatever was there
          previously.  For an Arrayref, the store message is sent to
          the vector representing the array.  If the Symbol table
          entry is not an array, an error occurs.

      (c) Statement-> `(' `goto' Label `)'

          Control transfers to the statement referred to by the Label.
          An error occurs if the Label is not defined.

      (d) Statement-> `(' `if' `(' Relop Expression Expression `)'
          Label `)'
          Relop-> `=' | `<' | `>' | `!=' | `>=' | `<='

          The two Expressions are compared according to the given
          Relop, and if the comparison is true, control transfers to
          the statement, as for the goto statement.

      (e) Statement-> `(' `print' { Printable }... `)'
          Printable-> String | Expression

          Each of the operands is printed in sequence.  A space is
          printed before each expression in the list of values, but
          not before strings.  Expresions are evaluated to a number
          before being printed.  A newline is output at the end of the
          print statement.  print statements are the only place
          Strings may occur in mbir.

      (f) Statement-> `(' `input' Memory { Memory }... `)'

          Numeric values are read in and assigned to the input
          variables in sequence.  Arguments might be elements of an
          array.  For each value read into a Memory, the value is
          inserted into the Symbol table under that variable's key.
          For arrays, the array must already exist and the subscript
          not be out of bounds.

          If an invalid value (anything that is not a number?) is
          read, the value returned is nan.  If end of file is
          encountered, the value returned is nan and the variable eof
          is entered into the symbol table with the value 1.  The
          value of nan can be computed using the expression (/ 0.0
          0.0).  Counterintuitively, the expression (= nan nan) is
          false.

EXPRESSIONS
     Expressions consistitute the computational part of the language.
     All values dealt with at the expression level are real numbers.
     Invalid computations, such as division by zero and infinite
     results do not cause computation to stop.  The value just
     propagates according to the rules of real or complex arithmetic
     or produces not a number (nan).  The result of using complex
     numbers is undefined.

      (a) Expression-> `(' Binop Expression Expression `)'
          Expression-> `(' Unop Expression `)'
          Expression-> `(' Function Expression `)'
          Expression-> Constant
          Expression-> Memory
          Binop-> `+' | `-' | `*' | `/' | `^'
          Unop-> `+' | `-'

          Constants are numbers.  Names of Functions, Arrayrefs, and
          Variables all look like identifiers and their meaning is
          given by context.  (^ x y) is exponentiation ($ x sup y $)

LEXICAL SYNTAX
     Comments being with a semi-colon and end at the end of a line.
     Strings are delimited by double-quote marks (").  Numbers consist
     of digits, an optional decimal point, and an optional exponent.
     Keywords and Variable names are atoms.  All of this is taken care
     of by Scheme's builtin read.

BUILTIN SYMBOLS
     In addition to the operators that are part of the language, the
     following functions are part of the function table:  abs, acos,
     asin, atan, ceil, cos, exp, floor, log, log10, round, sin, sqrt,
     tan, trunc.
     The following are part of the initial variable table:
     nan = (/ 0.0 0.0);  eof = 0.0;  pi = (acos -1.0);  e = (exp 1.0).

5.  Program Structure

The program will be read in by Scheme's read function, and represented
internally as a list of statements, each statement having its own
structure.  After reading in the program, all labels must be put into
a hash table, the key being the label itself and the value being the
particular statement it refers to.

Interpretation will then proceed down the list from the first
statement to the last.  The interpreter stops when it runs off the end
of the list.  A control transfer is executed by fetching the address
of a statement from the label table.

All variables are either real numbers or vectors of real numbers.
Another hash table is used whose keys are variable names and whose
values are real numbers, vectors of real numbers, or single parameter
functions.  An array subscript operation and a function call are
syntactically ambiguous, but are disambiguated at run time by checking
the symbol table.  An uninitialized variable should be treated as 0.

Your program should not crash, no matter what the input.  If a
detectable unforseen condition happens due to user error, a message
should be printed, giving the name of the file and the statement
number.

The usual arithmetic results for infinities are printed by the runtime
system, and these should be generated wherever possible.  Division by
zero, for example, should produce one of these quantities (+inf.0,
-inf.0, +nan.0).  Add 0.0 to all input numbers to ensure that they are
converted to real numbers.  Also look at the functions to see which
ones need special treatment.

You may ignore the directory mini-basic.d/mb-programs.d which contains
source code and a translator from Mini Basic to mbir.  You may also
ignore the directory translator, which contains the mb to mbir
translator itself, written in Ocaml.

6.  Functional Style

Programming should be done in entirely functional style, except for
maintenance of the symbol tables.  That means do not use any
imperative functions except as outlined below.  In Scheme, imperative
functions end with a bang (!) to indicate that an assignment is being
made.  Symbol tables are created with make-hash and updated with hash-
set!.  The symbol tables are as follows:

 (a) *stmt-table* contains all of the individual statement
     interpreters.  It is initialized at the beginning of execution
     and thereafter never modified.

 (b) *function-table* is used to hold all of the functions, which
     include the operators.  This is initialized when the program
     begins using a for-each loop containing a lambda.  (See the
     example symbols.scm).

 (c) *variable-table* holds the value of all variables, and is updated
     as needed during interpretation of the program.  Whenever a
     variable in the symbol table is not found, the value 0 is
     returned.  The variable table is initialized with the variables
     described in the section ``builtin symbols''.

 (d) *array-table* is used to hold all arrays defined in the program.
     Arrays and variables are in separate namespaces.  Arrays are
     created with make-vector and updated with vector-set!.

 (e) *label-table* is used to hold addresses of each line, one level
     up from statements.  This is initialized by scanning the list
     returned by (read) when the program begins.

Except for hash-set!  and vector-set!  as outlined above, no
imperative functions are permitted.  Use functional style only.

7.  Pseudocode Outline

The data structure consists of a recursively nested list:

 (a) The top level list consists of a sequence of lines.  Each line is
     pointed at by the car of a cell in the top level list.

 (b) Each line consists of a line number, an optional label, which is
     always a symbol?, and an optional statement, which is always a
     pair?.  Use null?  to determine whether not something exists.  Do
     not use list?.

 (c) A statement consists of a keyword followed by operands, mostly
     expressions.

 (d) An expression uses prefix notation in standard Scheme format.

A suggested outline and description of some of the functions follows:

 (a) After reading in the program, make one pass over the top level,
     checking for a label in each line.  Each label should be inserted
     into the label hash with a pointer to the top level node (not the
     line).

 (b) Write a function interpret-program takes the top level list as an
     argument and checks to see if there is a statement.

      (i) If there is no statement, call interpret-program recursively
          with the cdr of the top level node as the continuation.

     (ii) If there is a statement, look up the keyword in the
          statement hash and call interpret-statement, where statement
          is the keyword found in the statement.

     (iii) This function should then call interpret-program with its
          continuation for a statement that is not a control transfer,
          or for a statement that is a control transfer that is not
          taken.

     (iv) If this function has a control transfer, or if it is a
          statement that has a control transfer that is taken, call
          interpret-program recursively with the cdr, as explained
          above.

 (c) Write separate functions interpret-statement for each one of the
     keyword in the language.

 (d) The function evaluate-expression is called by a statement
     interpreter.

      (i) It looks up the function in the function table.

     (ii) It uses map to call evaluate-expression for each of the
          arguments to the function.

     (iii) Then use apply to apply the function to the list of results
          obtained.

     (iv) Subscripting arrays will require a special case.

8.  What to Submit

Submit files:  README and mbir.scm.  (And PARTNER if you are doing
pair programming.)  mbir.scm must be runnable by using it as the
command word of any shell command, and hence the execute bit must be
turned on (chmod +x).  It will be run as a shell script, and hence the
first line must be the following hashbang:
   #!/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cse112-wm/usr/racket/bin/mzscheme -qr

Make sure that the Unix command which mzscheme responds with the same
executable.  Important note:  This must be the first line in your
script, and your id should be after it.  Be sure there are no carriage
return characters in the file.

If you are doing pair programming, one partner should submit mbir.scm,
but both should submit the README and PARTNER files, as specified in
the pair programming guidelines.  If you are not pair programming,
read the section ``Solo programming''.

Be sure to use checksource to verify basic formatting.  This script,
and other scripts, such as cid and elimcr, are in
   /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/cse112-wm/bin
which should also be put in your $PATH environment variable.

The .score/ subdirectory contains instructions to the graders.  Be
sure your program runs with the test script.  If your program runs
when typed in manually from the command line, but not using the
script, you will receive no points for execution and testing.

9.  Debugging

To make it easier to debug, run the program interactively and call
functions directly from the interactive REPL (read eval print loop).
This can be done in several ways:

 (a) Use interactive mode in mzscheme and call individual functions
     interactively at the prompt:
        -bash$ mzscheme
        > (load "mbir.scm")
        > ...

 (b) Put the following line in your .bash_profile:
        alias debug-mbir='mzscheme -f mbir.scm -i -- -d'
     Then, for debugging purposes only, you may use the command
        debug-mbir program.mbir
     to run the program.  After loading mbir.scm, it turns on the
     *DEBUG* flag and then runs the program.  After that you see the
     interactive prompt for the REPL (read eval print loop) which you
     can then use to call functions directly from the command line.

 (c) Another alternative is to put the definition of *DEBUG* in the
     file itself and comment out the call to main.  Then call main or
     other functions directly from the REPL.

When running the program in producton mode, call it directly from the
command line using the command mbir.scm, without using the name
mzscheme at the command line.
